# PowerTrader AI V1.00 - Fork Improvements Summary

**Forked from:** [garagesteve1155/PowerTrader_AI](https://github.com/garagesteve1155/PowerTrader_AI)  
**Fork Maintainer:** Jim  
**Version:** 1.00 (as of February 27, 2026)  
**Primary Focus:** Small account optimization and enhanced risk management

---

## Overview

This fork transforms garagesteve's large-account focused PowerTrader AI into a comprehensive trading system optimized for accounts of all sizes, with particular emphasis on small account (<$2,500) profitability and capital preservation. All improvements maintain 100% backward compatibility with the original system.

---

## Major Feature Additions

### 1. **Three-Tier Account Mode System** *(pt_trader.py)*

**Original Behavior:**
- Single configuration optimized for large accounts ($10,000+)
- No account size detection or adaptive settings
- Fixed 0.005% position sizing (unsuitable for small accounts)

**Improvements:**
```python
account_mode options:
  - "auto": Automatic detection based on account value
  - "small": Force small account mode regardless of size
  - "force_existing": 100% original behavior (backward compatible)
```

**New Method:** `_apply_account_tier_settings()`
- Detects account size on startup
- Applies appropriate settings based on `small_account_threshold: 2500`
- Graceful fallback to standard settings on error

---

### 2. **Small Account Optimization Suite** *(pt_trader.py)*

Comprehensive parameter overrides specifically designed for accounts under $2,500:

| Parameter | Original | Small Account | Impact |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Position Sizing** | 0.005% ($0.50 on $250) | 10.0% ($25 on $250) | 5,000% increase in capital deployment |
| **DCA Strategy** | Exponential (2.0x multiplier) | Linear (1.0x multiplier) | Prevents account-destroying position growth |
| **DCA Levels** | 7 levels (-2.5% to -50%) | 3 levels (-7.5%, -15%, -25%) | Wider spacing, fewer aggressive entries |
| **DCA Frequency** | 2 per 24 hours | 1 per 24 hours | Prevents panic averaging |
| **Profit Targets** | +2.5% / +5.0% | +5.0% / +8.0% | Higher profit-to-loss ratio |
| **Trailing Gap** | 0.5% | 1.5% | Reduces noise exits, captures larger moves |
| **Position Limits** | Unlimited | Maximum 3 concurrent | Prevents correlation overload |
| **Reserve Cash** | 0% | 20% minimum | Ensures liquidity for opportunities |
| **Hard Stop Loss** | None | -35% with neural override | Capital preservation floor |
| **Neural DCA Confirmation** | Not required | Required | Quality-over-quantity DCA entries |

---

### 3. **Hard Stop Loss System** *(pt_trader.py)*

**Original Behavior:**
- No automatic loss protection
- Positions could drawdown to -50% or more
- Required manual intervention to exit losing trades

**New Feature:** `_check_hard_stop_loss()`
- Automatic market sell at -35% loss
- **Intelligent Override:** One-time neural L7 signal override allows recovery attempt before forced exit
- Clears all DCA state, trailing stop state, and override flags on trigger
- Prevents catastrophic losses on small accounts

**Configuration:**
```json
"hard_stop_enabled": true,
"hard_stop_pct": -35.0
```

---

### 4. **Tiered Profit Taking System** *(pt_trader.py)*

**Original Behavior:**
- Single trailing stop exit
- All-or-nothing position closure
- No partial profit securing

**New Three-Tier Exit Strategy:**
```
Tier 1: +7.0% gain → Sell 33% of position (secure profit)
Tier 2: +15.0% gain → Sell 50% of remainder (lock in bigger gains)
Tier 3: Trail remainder until stopped out (capture potential moonshots)
```

**Configuration:**
```json
"profit_mode": "tiered",
"tiered_profit_t1_pct": 7.0,
"tiered_profit_t1_sell_pct": 33,
"tiered_profit_t2_pct": 15.0,
"tiered_profit_t2_sell_pct": 50,
"trailing_gap_pct": 0.6
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces risk of giving back all gains on reversals
- Captures larger moves while securing partial profits
- Optimizes risk/reward for small account compounding

---

### 5. **Reserve Capital Management** *(pt_trader.py)*

**Original Behavior:**
- No minimum cash reserve requirement
- Bot could deploy 100% of capital
- Left no buffer for DCA opportunities or volatility

**New Method:** `_check_position_limits()`
- Enforces `reserve_minimum_pct` before any buy or DCA order
- Formula: `(buying_power - order_cost) >= (total_account_value × reserve_minimum_pct)`
- Default: 20% reserve on small accounts ($50 kept liquid on $250 account)
- Prevents over-deployment and maintains dry powder

---

### 6. **Enhanced GUI Metrics Dashboard** *(pt_hub.py)*

**Original Display:**
- Total Account Value
- Holdings Value
- Buying Power
- % In Trade
- DCA Levels
- Total Realized P&L

**Four New Metrics Added:**

**1. Win Rate %**
```
Win Rate: 68.4% (13W / 6L of 19 closed)
```
- Calculated from `trade_history.jsonl`
- Shows percentage of profitable trades
- Provides transparency on strategy effectiveness

**2. Average Win / Average Loss**
```
Avg Win / Avg Loss: $4.23 / -$2.87
```
- Separate averages for winning and losing trades
- Critical metric for evaluating risk/reward ratio
- Helps identify if current settings are optimal

**3. Best / Worst Performing Coin**
```
Best / Worst Coin: BTC ($18.42) / ETH (-$4.12)
```
- Groups trades by symbol, sums realized P&L
- Identifies which assets work best with current strategy
- Helps with coin selection decisions

**4. Hard Stops Triggered Count**
```
Hard Stops Triggered: 2
```
- Counts trades tagged as "HARD_STOP" in history
- Monitors frequency of protective exits
- Early warning if market conditions or settings need adjustment

**Implementation:**
- All computed in existing `_refresh_pnl()` method
- Uses existing `trade_history.jsonl` and `pnl_ledger.json` files
- No new file dependencies or API calls required

---

### 7. **Corrected Account Value Calculation** *(pt_trader.py)*

**Original Behavior:**
- `get_account_value()` returned only buying power (available cash)
- Ignored value of currently held positions
- Resulted in incorrect account size detection and GUI display

**Fix:**
```python
def get_account_value(self) -> float:
    buying_power = self.get_buying_power()
    held_cost = self.get_cost_of_held_positions()
    return buying_power + held_cost
```

**Impact:**
- True account value displayed in GUI (e.g., $248.09 instead of $29.46)
- Accurate tier detection even when capital is deployed
- Correct reserve calculations in position limit checks

---

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Bug #1: Unicode Emoji Crash (Windows)

**Problem:**
- Added emoji characters (💰🎯🛑) to console output
- Windows Command Prompt (cp1252 encoding) cannot render Unicode emojis
- Bot crashed immediately on startup

**Fix:**
- Replaced all emojis with ASCII bracket tags: `[SMALL ACCOUNT MODE]`, `[HARD STOP]`, `[ALLOCATION]`
- Ensures cross-platform compatibility

---

### Bug #2: NameError - `recent_dca` Undefined

**Problem:**
- During DCA logic reorganization, line `recent_dca = self._dca_window_count(symbol)` was accidentally removed
- Referenced before definition → instant crash on any DCA attempt

**Fix:**
- Re-added calculation in correct position before first reference
- Verified all DCA paths include proper variable initialization

---

### Bug #3: Instance Variable Not Set in Non-Small Modes

**Problem:**
- `_apply_account_tier_settings()` returned early in "force_existing" and "standard" modes
- Never set `self.start_allocation_pct` in those code paths
- Bot used hardcoded 0.005% instead of user's configured value

**Fix:**
- Set all instance variables in every code path, including early returns
- Ensures consistent behavior across all account modes

---

## Configuration File Enhancements

### Extended `gui_settings.json` Structure

**New Top-Level Settings:**
```json
{
  "account_mode": "auto",
  "small_account_threshold": 2500,
  "small_account_settings": { ... }
}
```

**New Small Account Settings Block:**
```json
"small_account_settings": {
  "start_allocation_pct": 10.0,
  "dca_multiplier": 1.0,
  "dca_levels": [-7.5, -15.0, -25.0],
  "max_dca_buys_per_24h": 1,
  "pm_start_pct_no_dca": 8.0,
  "pm_start_pct_with_dca": 5.0,
  "trailing_gap_pct": 1.5,
  "trade_start_level": 4,
  "hard_stop_enabled": true,
  "hard_stop_pct": -35.0,
  "max_positions": 3,
  "reserve_minimum_pct": 20.0,
  "require_neural_dca_confirmation": true,
  "profit_mode": "tiered",

  "tiered_profit_t1_sell_pct": 33,
  "tiered_profit_t2_pct": 15.0,
  "tiered_profit_t2_sell_pct": 50
}
```

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Safe Configuration Loading

**Original:**
```python
setting = config['key']  # KeyError if missing
```

**Improved:**
```python
setting = config.get('key', safe_default_value)  # Never crashes
```

**Applied to:**
- All new settings in `_apply_account_tier_settings()`
- All tier-specific parameter loads
- All GUI metric calculations

---

### Error Handling

**Added comprehensive try-except blocks:**
- Around all new methods (`_apply_account_tier_settings`, `_check_hard_stop_loss`, `_check_position_limits`)
- Around GUI metric calculations in `pt_hub.py`
- Graceful degradation - missing features don't crash the bot
- Falls back to safe defaults on any exception

---
